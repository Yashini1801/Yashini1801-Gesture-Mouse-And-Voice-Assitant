## Gesture-Mouse-Voice-Assistant

A Python-based virtual assistant combining gesture recognition, mouse control, and voice-based interaction. This project enhances user productivity and accessibility by integrating voice commands, gesture recognition, and system control features.

Note: Use Python version: 3.8.5

## üöÄ Features
- **Voice Assistant**: Perform system tasks, search the web, and interact with applications via voice commands.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Control mouse movements and system actions using hand gestures.
- **System Automation**: Copy, paste, open files, and navigate directories with simple voice or gesture commands.
- **Proton Personality**: Your AI assistant "Proton" can greet, respond, and provide assistance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Gesture-Mouse-Voice-Assistant.git
   cd Gesture-Mouse-Voice-Assistant
   ```

2. Create and activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   conda create --name gest python=3.8.5
   conda activate gest
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

4. Install additional libraries:
   ```bash
   conda install PyAudio
   conda install pywin32
   ```

5. Navigate to the source directory:
   ```bash
   cd to till src folder
   ```
   Command may look like: cd C:\Users\.....\Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse\src

6. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python Proton.py
   ```

( You can enable Gesture Recognition by using the command "Proton Launch Gesture Recognition" )

Or to run only Gesture Recognition without the voice assisstant:

Uncomment last 2 lines of Code in the file Gesture_Controller.py

```bash
   python Gesture_Controller.py
   ```

2. **Left Click**:  
   - **Gesture**: Show a closed fist and release it quickly (or similar predefined gesture).  
   - **Function**: Simulates a left mouse button click.

3. **Right Click**:  
   - **Gesture**: Show a specific finger gesture (e.g., two fingers forming a "V").  
   - **Function**: Simulates a right mouse button click.

4. **Scroll Up**:  
   - **Gesture**: Move your hand upward while keeping fingers extended.  
   - **Function**: Scrolls the screen or page upward.

5. **Scroll Down**:  
   - **Gesture**: Move your hand downward while keeping fingers extended.  
   - **Function**: Scrolls the screen or page downward.

### **Gesture-Based System Controls**
1. **Zoom In**:  
   - **Gesture**: Move two fingers apart (spread gesture).  
   - **Function**: Performs a zoom-in action (e.g., pinch zoom-in for images or maps).

2. **Zoom Out**:  
   - **Gesture**: Move two fingers closer (pinch gesture).  
   - **Function**: Performs a zoom-out action.

3. **Volume Control**:  
   - **Gesture**: Move your hand left/right or upward/downward with a specific posture.  
   - **Function**: Adjusts the system volume (increase or decrease).

### **Static Controls**:
1. **Greet Proton**:  
   - Command: `hello`  
   - Response: Greets you with a suitable greeting based on the time of day.
